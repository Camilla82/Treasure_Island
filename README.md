This repository is part of my "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu.

In day 3, we were asked to create a "choose your own adventure" game.

You are stranded on a desert island and your mission is to find the treasure.

Will you survive and get the gold or perish? 

What we learned with this example:

If statements
Control flow with if/else and conditional operators
Logical operators
Multiple if statements in succession
